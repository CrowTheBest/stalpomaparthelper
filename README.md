# stalpomaparthelper
Client side mapart utility mod designed for 2b2t mapart enthusiasts!

# About
This mod was made because I am too lazy to manually copy 2000+ unique maps more than once. Some of the features include: map copier, auto locker, map downloader, and a duplicate checker.

# What is SMI?
SMI (Stalpo Mapart Index) is a system used to try and archive all maparts on 2b2t by giving them each a unique id. Sadly I suck at coding and planning so this collection will have to be manually updated for now but this mod comes with the current full list that can be found in .minecraft/maparts_smi. If you have any maparts that aren't indexed yet please contact me!

# Applies to everything below
To use a lot of the features you need to have a completely empty inventory (not including hotbar). Also some of it is bugged / doesn't work in singleplayer and on world downloads.

# How to download maps
1. Have a shulker full of maps you want to download
2. Make sure they are loaded (turn on map copier with numpad 5, open the shulk to take the maps, then open the shulk to put them back and turn map copier back off)
3. Open the shulker and press numpad 1
4. You can find your maps downloaded at .minecraft/maparts

# How to check for duplicates
1. Have a shulker full of maps you want to check and all the maps you want to check against already downloaded
2. Make sure they are loaded (turn on map copier with numpad 5, open the shulk to take the maps, then open the shulk to put them back and turn map copier back off)
3. Open the shulker and press numpad 2
4. Now all of the duplicates are moved to your inventory

# How to check maps SMI's
1. Have a shulker full of maps you want to check and the most recent smi collection in .minecraft/maparts_smi
2. Make sure they are loaded (turn on map copier with numpad 5, open the shulk to take the maps, then open the shulk to put them back and turn map copier back off)
3. Open the shulker and press numpad 3
4. Now you can see in chat the SMI of each map in the shulker

# How to auto copy maps
1. Have a shulker full of maps that you want to copy, an empty shulker to put the copied maps in, a crafting table, and empty maps in your hotbar
2. Toggle auto copy with numpad 5

4. Open the crafting table to copy the maps
5. Open the original shulk to put the original set back
6. Open the other shulk to put the copied set in
7. Turn auto copy back off with numpad 5

# How to auto lock maps
1. Have a shulker full of maps that you want to lock, a cartography table, and glass panes in your hotbar
2. Make sure they are loaded (turn on map copier with numpad 5, open the shulk to take the maps, then open the shulk to put them back and turn map copier back off)
3. Toggle auto locker with numpad 6
4. Open the shulker and press numpad 3 to take all non locked maps
